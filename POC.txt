Front-End Case Study: Social Support Application with AI Assistance

1.Background

You are building a new front-end for a government social support portal. The portal must allow citizens to apply for financial assistance easily, quickly, and with smart help.

You will design a multi-step form wizard and integrate the OpenAI GPT API to assist users in writing certain text fields.

2.What You Need to Build

A 3-Step Application Form Wizard:

Step Section Fields AI Assistance
1 Personal Information Name, National ID, Date of Birth, Gender, Address, City, State, Country,
Phone, Email No
2 Family & Financial Info Marital Status, Dependents, Employment Status, Monthly Income,
Housing Status No
3 Situation Descriptions 1.Current Financial Situation
2.Employment Circumstances
3.Reason for Applying Yes (Help Me Write button)

Main Features:

•Multi-step form with progress bar.
•Responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop).
•English + Arabic (RTL) language support.
•Accessibility friendly (basic ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).
•Save progress locally (e.g., LocalStorage).
•Submit data (mock API call).

AI Integration:

•Add a "Help Me Write" button near the 3 textarea fields in Step 3.
•Clicking the button sends a request to OpenAI GPT API to generate a text suggestion.
•Show the suggestion in a popup where the user can Accept, Edit, or Discard.
•Handle errors gracefully (timeout, failure).
